## Introduction

LyxUI is a modern React UI framework designed to help you build your own component library with flexibility, consistency, and aesthetic appeal in mind. Inspired by frameworks like Aceternity UI and Shadcn UI, LyxUI emphasizes:

- ðŸ›  **Open Code** â€“ fully editable source components
- ðŸ”„ **Composable API** â€“ reusable, consistent interfaces
- ðŸšš **Simple Distribution** â€“ easy to extract and share components
- ðŸŽ¨ **Stylish Defaults** â€“ attractive baseline styles out-of-the-box
- ðŸ¤– **AIâ€‘Friendly** â€“ clean code structure ready for LLM integration

## Why LyxUI?

<Callout title="Open Code">
  Each component is shipped as editable sourceâ€”you can inspect, tweak, and
  evolve everything directly.
</Callout>

- **Transparent architecture** â€“ modify its internal logic or styling.
- **Composable Interfaces** â€“ props align across components (e.g. `variant`, `size`, `className`) for predictable APIs.
- **Distribution ready** â€“ extract individual components into other projects via CLI or flat-file layout.
- **Styled for impact** â€“ defaults are carefully selected for clean, cohesive UI.
- **AIâ€‘Ready** â€“ code consistency makes LyxUI easy for AI to analyze, generate, or enhance.
